# C-LinkList
This is my first notebook in learning data structure and github.

DLB.cpp is a demo shows how a linklist was created in C/C++, and linklist is the very foudation in learning data structure.

Stack.cpp is a demo shows how to create a Stack structure using C/C++, and it's also  a kind of linklist. And there is a fibonacci generator in the demo.

Queue.cpp is a demo shows how to create a queue using C/C++, and it's aldo a kind of LinkList.

tree.cpp is a demo shows how to create a tree using C/C++.And contains three traversals of binary tree.

qipao.cpp縲』uanze.cpp縲』uanze-op.cpp縲（nsert_order.cpp縲《hell_order.cpp are different order algorithms, and xuanze-op.cpp is an optimized algorithm for xuanze.cpp

graph.cpp is a demo shows how to create a graph using C/C++.
