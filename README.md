# C-LinkList
This is my first notebook in learning data structure and github.

DLB.cpp is a demo shows how a linklist was created in C/C++, and linklist is the very foudation in learning data structure.

Stack.cpp is a demo shows how to create a Stack structure using C/C++, and it's also  a kind of linklist. And there is a fibonacci generator in the demo.
